Each team must submit one copy of this self evaluation form. 
The members of each team should discuss how they

  	                        A 	       B
meetings 	  	        0

	N/A

(b) Did you complete the assignment?

	I did NOT complete it. Had issues implementing LOG BARRIER

(c) What were your major strengths and weaknesses in doing this
    assignment (individually or in a team)?

	My strength is techincally the coding background, making
	scripts and understanding the code language.

	The biggest weakness was understanding the log barrier.
	Though a have a rough understand, implementation to match
	the reference binary was difficult.

    If in a team, also discuss how your team worked together.
(d) What  lessons did you learn from these events.

	See the tutor more often and go to office hours more
	often.

(e) If in a team, whether and how you plan to change the way
    your work together .

	N/A

(f) Anything else that comes to mind.

	Great project. But wished provided a little more details
	regarding the log barrier. Most times, the details were 
	vague. But that can also be due to my part in not asking
	the approriate questions.
